# WaWuserManagementService

## Worth-a-Watch's User Management Service provides the API for the following login processes:
- *User registration*
- *Authentication*
- *Authorization*

## In addition, this Service also provides the API for more profile-related elements:
- *User profile additional information*
- *Additional user profile settings*
- *User preferences*

This service will need to communicate with the WaWController, as well as with the collections for user login and user profile.
